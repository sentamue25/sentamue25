### Code.org GameLab
[robotFace](https://sentamue25.github.io/robotFace)
> In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

[Captioned Scenes](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/5R_I1LmAhuvBcc1gHe_gPp6kpYE15cZwck5TT7iBEKc)
>  A creative project of this unit. Using the problem-solving process as a model.

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/Ij4JCrzG5w7XjALoQWzJKTBn9QVPobZA8SEivBOBqrU)
> In this project I collabrated with another student to create multiple sprites with updated properties, conditionals responding to user input, and additonal conditonals that were triggered by a sprite property.

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/dsGjFQRS4UDzsUmT36QHVgqecHx6_Xs85YLt8Els9ig)
> In this project I collabrated with another student to use new types of sprite movement and collision detection to create a type of game with backgrounds that move across the screen from side to side.

[Design a Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/fPPlOTh8rrGWo9pZBX1Oh1cz3I4pP5dRaObC3ZV1iio)
>In  my project, a bear is trying to reach the candy, by moving towards the candy and the bear has to jump to reach the candy. But before the bear can successfully get the candy, the bear has to get over the obstacles.

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/ETIE3chFmvSOTBzbhBVsOr28cPBgtrS5rsBan0Y-2zA)
> In this project I used differant collisions to make a simple flyer game.

[Platform Jumper](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/MIFCgQbfiR5FXLdCMWfTlge9gUf_LBDaRfRWj4qMND4)
> In this project I used the prolem solving process to make a platfrom jumper game.

[My Piano](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=362b9905-ddfb-4971-9c5a-f58d77c4ce09)
> In this project everytime i played a piano note the sound of each piano note would play.

[Music Maker](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=ba1f9a02-d940-491f-979d-b893b0c1715c)
> In this project I pick which instrument i want to play then music from the instrument starts playing, but when I press stop the music will no longer player from the instrument.

[ Hello It's Me](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=c6a36b49-c7b7-4f42-9b73-bf3906fcff2b)
> A project where I have three images that show a Cat, a Dog, and a Bear and you can hear the way they sound.

[Find The Gold](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=53e3c2fb-211f-4ad7-b1fe-52887f1120f9)
> In this project I worked with a partner to use the accelermoter to track the movements of the Ipad to control the ball.

[Food Chase](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=ad5fba31-3510-4095-a934-254519aae0cb)
> In this project I worked with a partner to create a game where the player can control a red ball with moving action. The ball chases food to “eat” and grow in size, but has to avoid the green ball.

[Creative Task Unit 1](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/exercise/4132/)
> I  used the coding elements I have learned thus far in Unit 1 to create a project of my own design.
